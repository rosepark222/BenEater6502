# there are less than 200 instructions in 6502. Can you classify them into groups so that easier for students to learn?

Absolutely! The **6502** microprocessor has a famously compact and regular instruction set, with **56 official instructions** (not 200!), each of which can be used with different addressing modes, resulting in 151 valid opcodes. For teaching, it’s very helpful to classify these instructions into functional groups. Here’s a clear breakdown:

## 6502 Instruction Groups

### 1. **Load \& Store Operations**

- **Load**: Move data from memory to a register.
    - `LDA` (Load Accumulator)
    - `LDX` (Load X Register)
    - `LDY` (Load Y Register)
- **Store**: Move data from a register to memory.
    - `STA` (Store Accumulator)
    - `STX` (Store X Register)
    - `STY` (Store Y Register)


### 2. **Register Transfers**

- Move data between registers.
    - `TAX` (Transfer Accumulator to X)
    - `TXA` (Transfer X to Accumulator)

### 5. **Arithmetic Operations**

- Math with the accumulator.
    - `ADC` (Add with Carry)

### 6. **Shift \& Rotate Operations**

- Bit shifting and rotating.
    - `ASL` (Arithmetic Shift Left)
    - `LSR` (Logical Shift Right)
    - `ROL` (Rotate Left)
    - `ROR` (Rotate Right)


### 7. **Control Flow**

- Change the sequence of execution.
    - `JMP` (Jump)
    - `JSR` (Jump to Subroutine)
    - `RTS` (Return from Subroutine)
    - `BRK` (Break/Interrupt)
    - `RTI` (Return from Interrupt)


### 8. **Branching (Conditional Jumps)**

- Branch based on flag conditions.
    - `BCC` (Branch if Carry Clear)
    - `BCS` (Branch if Carry Set)
    - `BEQ` (Branch if Equal)
    - `BMI` (Branch if Minus)
    - `BNE` (Branch if Not Equal)
    - `BPL` (Branch if Positive)
    - `BVC` (Branch if Overflow Clear)
    - `BVS` (Branch if Overflow Set)


### 9. **Status Flag Changes**

- Set or clear processor status flags.
    - `CLC` (Clear Carry)
    - `SEC` (Set Carry)
    - `CLD` (Clear Decimal)
    - `SED` (Set Decimal)
    - `CLI` (Clear Interrupt Disable)
    - `SEI` (Set Interrupt Disable)
    - `CLV` (Clear Overflow)


### 10. **No Operation**

- Does nothing (used for timing).
    - `NOP` (No Operation)


## **Summary Table**

| Group | Example Instructions |
| :-- | :-- |
| Load/Store | LDA, STA, LDX, STY |
| Register Transfers | TAX, TAY, TXA, TYA, TSX, TXS |
| Stack Operations | PHA, PLA, PHP, PLP |
| Logical Operations | AND, ORA, EOR, BIT |
| Arithmetic | ADC, SBC, CMP, CPX, CPY, INC, DEC |
| Shift/Rotate | ASL, LSR, ROL, ROR |
| Control Flow | JMP, JSR, RTS, BRK, RTI |
| Branching | BEQ, BNE, BCC, BCS, BMI, BPL, BVC, BVS |
| Status Flag Changes | CLC, SEC, CLD, SED, CLI, SEI, CLV |
| No Operation | NOP |

**Tip for students:**
Focus on learning the groups and their purposes. Once you understand what each group does, memorizing the individual instructions becomes much easier!

# 6502 coding tips from AI

 

### 1. Looping Exactly 256 Times Using INX and BNE

```assembly
    LDX #$00        ; Start X at 0
Loop:
    ; Do stuff here
    INX         ; Increment X
    BNE Loop    ; Loop until X wraps to 0 (after 256 times)
```


### 2. Unroll Loops for Maximum Speed

```assembly
    LDA #$00
    STA $0200
    STA $0201
    STA $0202
    STA $0203
    ; ...repeat as needed
```


### 3. Range Checking with CPX/CPY and Branches

```assembly
    LDX #$00
Loop:
    ; Do stuff here
    INX
    CPX #$10      ; Compare X to 16
    BNE Loop      ; Loop until X == 16
```


### 4. Conditional Branching with CMP and BEQ/BNE

```assembly
    CMP #10
    BEQ Equal
        ; Not equal code
        JMP Done
Equal:
    ; Equal code
Done:
```


### 5. Checking Bits Without Affecting A Using BIT

```assembly
    BIT $D000      ; Test bits at $D000
    BMI SetBit     ; Branch if bit 7 is set (negative flag)
    ; ...other code
SetBit:
    ; ...code if bit is set
```


### 6. Multiplying or Dividing by 2 Using Shifts and Rotates

```assembly
    ASL A          ; Multiply A by 2 (shift left)
    LSR A          ; Divide A by 2 (shift right)
    ROL A          ; Rotate left through carry
    ROR A          ; Rotate right through carry
```


### 7. Implementing Switch-Case Logic with a Jump Table

```assembly
    LDX index
    LDA TableLo,X
    STA $FE
    LDA TableHi,X
    STA $FF
    JMP ($FE)

TableLo: .byte <Addr0, <Addr1, <Addr2
TableHi: .byte >Addr0, >Addr1, >Addr2
```


### 8. Filling an Array Using STA addr,X in a Loop

```assembly
    LDX #$00
    LDA #$FF
Loop:
    STA $0400,X   ; Store value in array
    INX
    CPX #$10      ; Repeat for 16 bytes
    BNE Loop
```


### 9. Branching Over Code Instead of Using Else

```assembly
    CMP #5
    BNE NotFive
        ; Code for A == 5
        JMP End
NotFive:
    ; Code for A != 5
End:
```


### 10. Always Set or Clear Carry Before ADC/SBC

```assembly
    CLC           ; Clear carry before addition
    ADC #$10      ; Add 16 to A

    SEC           ; Set carry before subtraction
    SBC #$05      ; Subtract 5 from A
```
