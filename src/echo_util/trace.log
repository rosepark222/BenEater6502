--- 6502 Emulation Trace Log ---

Initialized 64KB RAM to zeros.
Loaded main program (327 bytes) from './a.out.hex' to 0x8000.
Loaded IRQ handler (5 bytes) to 0x0700.
Set Reset Vector (0xFFFC/D) to 0x8000.
Set IRQ/BRK Vector (0xFFFE/F) to 0x0700.

CPU Reset. Program Counter (PC) is now at 0x8000 (from Reset Vector).
